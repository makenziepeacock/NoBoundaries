Jones in some capacity attended to Purchase, excuse me ... So many of those dancers attended Purchase. So I decided to apply to that school and yeah, as I was saying, I got in seemingly on like the skin of my teeth. But my family was always really supportive of that experience. Initially, they wanted me to go to a historically black college, so I went to Morgan State for a year in Baltimore. But they didn't really have much of a dance program at Morgan State, so I reached out to a good friend of mine that was studying the visual arts at Purchase and went to visit her and while I was there, I planned on auditioning for the school and I've never looked back.",

It's so spread in a way that you can take a lot of different ... You could go in a lot of different directions. So by the time I was kind of like diving into the rave scene and then also just improvising in my room, playing Prince or playing The Cranberries or The Smiths or whatever I was listening to, at a certain point, I started getting more and more investigative about different ways of moving. And so when I saw my first dance performance when I was 16, it really opened my eyes to a whole other world of dance that I just hadn't even thought about or considered. My bed was really big in my kind of seemingly small room, so there wasn't much space to dance in. I could sit there, I could play my cello, I could play different instruments in my room, but I couldn't actually do much dancing there.

It's part of, probably, the irony of me making a show for my company, this piece called Dearest Home, which the thought for me was to divorce myself from that first love in making a work that's rooted in love, longing and loss. So the dancers never hear any music, it wasn't choreographed to any music. So that was the experience. But generally speaking, I try to find some kind of sound score to be playing with, or some kind of playlist, that connects me to the artist that I'm collaborating with.",

And one of them had been using a lot of Nina Simone and I'd gone to yoga class, one of my yoga classes, a couple nights before you were coming to town and my yoga teacher was playing some Nina and it just seemed right, it seemed like there was a nice ...

I think I went through definitely some ups and downs in terms of doubting myself and feeling that although I did receive this wonderful accolade, that I felt as if my peers, or other people that had maybe seen my work, didn't feel that I was deserving and I allowed that to kind of get in my head for a period of time. And/or feeling as if I needed to prove something to other people. But I think in a really beautiful full-circle way, the last year or so, I really decided that what I do needs to be enough for me. I wanna keep challenging myself but for myself and not for anyone else. I love the people I get to work with on a continuous basis and it's trying to figure out the best ways to support them, support me, support the work and ways in which I can kind of have some kind of longevity in my career.

Karen Young is our costume designer; she's really verbal and really dependable and just brilliant, so I listen to her. If my dancers are ever watching the work that they're not in, or work that they are in, they tell me the what's what and I appreciate that.

Darrell Grand Moultrie is another choreographer I speak to. Staycee Pearl, another choreographer. These people are folks that I can be really real with, stripped down. I don't have to feel bad if I feel bad. I think that was something, with the MacArthur, where people were like, \"Well, you can't struggle, you know, like you're fine. Financially, you should be good.\" But it's not sometimes about that. There are so many other facets to what we do and how we're doing it that can affect us emotionally and physically.

But I love that we can question that and we can show more examples of variety and the spectrum can constantly shift and change.

No, no, that's not a word. Can't think of the word.

I mean, when you're looking at his portrait in comparison to all of these other portraits, it's unapologetically colorful and filled with life and filled with pride. And I know that we are in a time when black folks are feeling good about themselves in a way that it seems that regardless of how much we are told that we aren't worth x, y, and z, we know that we are worth that times a billion times over. Art can do that. People can do that by coming together. The work that we make is creating a conversation and bringing people together to feel empowered. Art in general is empowering.

But so brief that sometimes it's not even listed in my bio. It was a great experience for a whole host of reasons. But I think the majority of my dance career, in terms of dancing for another company, came from dancing with David Dorfman, who I danced with, I think, for maybe five years. That's a different type of partnership and collaboration and one that I think has had a different type of impact on the work I make. We spent so much of the time talking in a room, and I think probably Bill does that as well, from what I experienced and what I know people have experienced, but in a different way that we're looking at community in a tighter-knit group of collaborators.",

I know that some of the things I'm doing fit into all of those categories. Sometimes they're out of the box, sometimes they're cliché, sometimes they're really redundant.

I mean I'm definitely in a better place in my life in general so ... Yeah, I don't know. What does a perfect day look like? Sometimes that day is a day when I know that I made a really exciting impact on my students that I get to work with at UCLA. Sometimes it's when I have a breakthrough in rehearsal with my dancers and collaborators. Sometimes it's knowing that I got through however long of a list of e-mails or phone calls I needed to make. Sometimes it's just knowing that I can achieve just one goal in my day, maybe it's just, \"You know what? Yes, today was crazy, but I found 40 minutes to go run at the gym. And that was just for me, it wasn't for anybody else.\" So just trying to make that space I think can create a perfect day. Yeah. And, yeah, getting rest, which is really hard to do. That's important. Generally speaking, those are probably those things. Maybe having a moment to connect with a good friend. Maybe see some art in some capacity. If Brandi releases a new song and I get to hear it, I'm sure that day would be the perfect day. It's just simple stuff for me that kind of can make my day.",

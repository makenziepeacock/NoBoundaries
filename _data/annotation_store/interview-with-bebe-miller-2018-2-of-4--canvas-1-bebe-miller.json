It has engendered a whole other level that maybe we didn't see coming. We forget that this an evolving form in step with its times.

One of the things that came up in the research for it was a conversation between Toni Morrison and Charlie Rose about paradise that she wrote in the late '90s, 98, 97, or so, where she made a very particular decision not identify the characters by race. She just said they are who they are and they know who they're talking to, so they don't have to say black person who I'm talking to. It's there. It's intrinsic. The reader then is there discovering from any vantage point who these people are, not through the assumed lens of these are black characters and so on and so forth. I think that in a way we are, what is this 20 years later, having absorbed that information in our lesson.",

One was an obvious just revisiting something that was made 30 years ago in a body that's now 30 years older. Working with you, alongside you and it's so interesting to still feel the impulses even I can't quite accomplish the moment brings back for me something about how it works in time, it works in its own musicality. It works in a musicality of a composed sound. I say that realizing that dancing to music is there's nothing new there, but rehearing the music of the dance in the body I feel is new for me. I feel like I'm rehearing what a body has to go through, not only in terms of its alignment with the music, but a sensation in time and how the crafting of that sensation in time was what I was doing 30 years ago, what I then aim to do 15 years ago and now have another opportunity to refine that. I should say that it's not so much to bring it back to what it was, but to really be true to the sequent tension and releases that it came from in order to ... Just not re-experiencing it, but there's something about that ordering of sensation that I feel is at the heart of the piece in a way that I wouldn't have been able to articulate 15 years ago or even 30 years ago.

It sounds so abstract, but it carries itself and the work is fitting a whole other sensibility into that form so that your sensibility carries it to the next place. The form of the piece is what survives, not it's reference to me or to you but ultimately to deliver the piece to the next audience. We've talked about that place in the music where we both go like we kind of want to cry a moment. It's just so you get to sit on the grass and you get to just be there and how exquisite that feeling is. Not exquisite choreography, but just that feeling is exquisite and ultimately that is what an audience is getting. We are just in service to that moment on a good day. Yeah.",

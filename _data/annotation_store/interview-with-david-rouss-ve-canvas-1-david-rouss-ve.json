But that having been said, I would say that in my own personal experience, a lot of African American choreographers and choreographers of color are choosing to make work that has some sort of social engagement, and even on that broad terrain, on that broad level, I think that's one of the things that unites some, if not all is that there is a strong desire to speak on the social world in which we live. And it maybe being done through a range of vocabularies, but there is that desire to comment, even if it's wide ranging. And one thing that ... I went to the IABD, International Association of Blacks in Dance concert the other day, and I will say, one of the things that ... because watching dance with an all black audience, it can be ... is the antithesis of watching it sometimes with an all white, or primarily white, modern dance audience. They're very cool and dry, and if somebody does something dazzling physically ... I'm doing this because like, 12 pirouettes. Or four. Black people are on their feet.",

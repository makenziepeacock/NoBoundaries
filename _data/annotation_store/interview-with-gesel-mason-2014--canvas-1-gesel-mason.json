And that's so relevant and current. And I love that my body is sort of evolving through all of this as well. So, it's kind of amazing to be part of a living, evolving archive. And I feel like it's influenced my dancing. When I first did this, I wasn't thinking of myself necessarily as a black dancer or someone who does black dance. And yet, through this journey, it's been so amazing to be like, \"Yes, I am a black dancer. And that is not all of who I am.\" And I've always known that, but in some ways, I felt like I was pushing against it because I didn't want to be labeled or seen in a certain way.

And I know that it's a label that is placed onto work, and nobody necessarily says, \"This is what I'm doing.\" People do the work. People investigate their cultures, their beings, their identity. And it doesn't make something just identity-based work. It's American work. It's what dance does, investigates, asks questions. And we all ask different questions about different things.

So he said, I couldn't use the Scandal Boys and I figured, once we hit the stage there's nothing he can do, it's not like he's going to get on stage, and in the middle of a show, stop and say, hey I told you not to use them. You know I already got half my money, so I don't really care. If you don't give me the rest, that's fine. And so I called that piece pure movement. Because I knew what we did that, I felt that street dance, before it was, again, we we're still calling ourselves street dancers, not hip hop dancers. Street dance was the purest dance vocabulary that there was. There is. And I felt like that for a long long time. Like there was nothing other purer, than a community dance. Dance that come from your community. Without any limitations or philosophies and things put on top of it. And I used to, I'm not an art major, but I took art throughout High School the whole time. So I used to draw and paint and all the stuff, and I still paint, but it's kind of like, so I writing one day, I was writing Rennie Harris, and like doing some graph, is pure movement. And then I realize, I was like oh shit. Harris, the letters I,S, is is. So I don't really need the other is so I just wrote Rennie Harris pure movement.",

Which turned out to be like, of course, whatever, and I wind up touring for another 20 years. So that's pretty much how it went down far as pure movement was concerned and then, I tried to recruit the best dancers. The best dancers didn't show up for rehearsal. The ones that did challenged me and was like well why do we have to repeat the movement over and over again. We got it. And I said okay do it. And they would mess it up, and I'm like you don't have it. But they don't like the fact that, they wanted me to tell em what the movement is, do it sloppy and that's it.",

And we can do that show right there and be tight. So they're used to that sort of thing, the idea of this is what it's going to be, and it's simple stuff and everyone thinks we practice for years, or whatever. But what I was doing, no, cuz I wanted to do some intricate stuff with street dance. Or was inspired to do it. And that just had, that was a street dance attitude. Always do something different. so when I got challenged, what well this aint really street dance. This aine really hip hop Rennie because you're doing blah blah and it's in a theater, and blah.

Because at some point in time you know, I feel like in Academia, it's about numbers right. And it's about education. You going to get some higher education which is great.

So at some point there's a give and take that Academia has to have in order to get those students. In regards to hip hop in the last 10 years students go into institutions of higher learning expecting that there's a hop hop teacher, who's teaching hip-hop? And then what happens is institution appeases to these students with a local teacher. Which you really can't, as an elective with someone, you can't really get a credit. But the students still not informed enough to go, well hold up, I want to be able to blah blah blah with this because, I've been doing this all my life, I'm 20, I'm 18, 19 years old. And I see the value and the relevance of this. So they're not informed yet mainly because lot of a lot of us have not become bilingual academically in order to speak that language to make the argument. We've needed help from the faculty that was already embedded and sometimes it's just one person and so the progression is slow.",

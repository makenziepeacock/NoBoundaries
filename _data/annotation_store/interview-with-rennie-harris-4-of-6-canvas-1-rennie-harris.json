The mayor's here and they want to know what we're talking about and blah blah blah. None of them cast. It was really a hard ... We didn't see the light of day till maybe 2001. Where, okay, Rennie has performance coming. But from 1991 till 2001, it was pushing through everybody's stereotypes of what hip hop was and is for them.",

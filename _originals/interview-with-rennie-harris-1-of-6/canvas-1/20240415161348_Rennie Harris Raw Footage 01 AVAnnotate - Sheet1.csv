00:06:22,00:06:57,"It's now 22 years, this 2014, it'll be 22 years. We started officially in 1992, but I started in '91 without knowing I was going to make a company. It was completely by accident, or happenstance, I guess, I don't know. Someone called me, as a matter of fact it was specifically Michael Pedretti from the Movement Theater International, who used to throw international mime festivals in Philadelphia.",Rennie Harris,"Interview, Transcript, Rennie Harris, Gesel Mason, You Are Why!, No Boundaries Performance 2183"
00:06:59,00:07:43,"I used to be a pantomime. Yeah. So, but it was a summer job which is interesting. It was a summer job, I was 13 or 14, something like that, and it was through the church, the Catholic church. And we used to have to go through the neighborhood ... Our job was to go through the neighborhood and mime out parables in the Bible. So, being, there was like, ""Lorenzo, you're a good dancer. This'll be a great job for you."" So I went to mime training school kind of thing, and then ... And what was cool about it was I was embarrassed, but I had white face on.",Rennie Harris,"Interview, Transcript, Rennie Harris, Gesel Mason, You Are Why!, No Boundaries Performance 2184"
00:07:43,00:08:19,"So no one knew it was me until I started dancing. So I tried not to dance as much, I just tried to do like the, dee dee, you know, all the stuff. Because all the gangster guys and all the thugs is like, ""Is that Lorenzo?"" You know. So anyway, so anyway so that one thing led to another, I started doing ... I was popping. And I say that because what I started to understand at an early age, that popping was sort of an internal pantomime. And we actually entered pantomime competitions and things of that nature, or exhibitions.",Rennie Harris,"Interview, Transcript, Rennie Harris, Gesel Mason, You Are Why!, No Boundaries Performance 2185"
00:08:20,00:08:59,"And you know, and the discussion was, ""Was this pantomime?"" So then they started calling it the New Pantomime Festival, when we were involved in it. So that was sort of a small history that was happening outside of my little popping group that I had when I was 14. All that to say the guy who ran these festivals, his name was Michael Pedretti, called me up and said, ""Hey, I want you to choreograph 45 minutes at the next festival or performance."" And I thought it was a joke, I thought it was one of my friends trying to sound white, right?",Rennie Harris,"Interview, Transcript, Rennie Harris, Gesel Mason, You Are Why!, No Boundaries Performance 2186"
00:08:59,00:09:21,"And I was like, "" Whatever man, blah, blah, blah,"" and he's like, ""Yeah, we're going to pay you $1,500 and we're going to give you half now."" I was like, I knew it was a joke. Then I was like, ""I could be dead, man, you know there's a gun shot, there's a gunfight outside my house."" I said, ""Dude, you're going to pay me something. So let me get this straight, so you're going to pay me $1,500, you [owe 00:09:16] me $750 now, and the gig is a year from now?"" He's like, ""Yeah.""",Rennie Harris,"Interview, Transcript, Rennie Harris, Gesel Mason, You Are Why!, No Boundaries Performance 2187"
00:09:21,00:10:06,"I said, ""Cool, I'll take your money. I might not show up, but I'll take your money."" Because I thought it still was a joke, and then it turned out it wasn't, but I still felt like, I hadn't never been booked a year in advance. I'm like, ""What was that about?"" So I was like, ""That's crazy."" And so he said ... And I didn't know what to do. So I started creating 45 minutes. The backstory is that because I was sort of in hustle mode with street dance, before that I performed with Japanese Kabuki dancers. I performed with ballet dancers, modern dancers, African dancers, and in juxtaposition kind of deal.",Rennie Harris,"Interview, Transcript, Rennie Harris, Gesel Mason, You Are Why!, No Boundaries Performance 2188"
00:10:07,00:10:37,"And so and I would choreograph little things for them here and there. So I think, and in retrospect he saw something choreographically. With my group, The Scanner Boys, which is a street dance group, and what I was doing on my side gigs without them kind of thing. And he never answered a question like, ""What made you call me to think that I could do 45 minutes?"" Up to that point, I had never choreographed anything past 10 minutes in 1991, which was like, ""Okay.""",Rennie Harris,"Interview, Transcript, Rennie Harris, Gesel Mason, You Are Why!, No Boundaries Performance 2189"
00:10:38,00:11:16,"So anyway, long story short, I took house music, I mean house movement, and choreographed it to jazz. I did a popping solo too, just my breath kind of thing. And I did hip hop to a jazz fusion, and separated the styles and gave them different music. And so that was the beginning of like ... People who saw it was like ... they were speechless. I didn't know that I did anything, I thought it was the course. It's hip hop, that's what we do. We adopt, I mean we adapt to the situation.",Rennie Harris,"Interview, Transcript, Rennie Harris, Gesel Mason, You Are Why!, No Boundaries Performance 2190"
00:11:17,00:11:47,"It's theater, so let's figure out how to freak it out and twist it, do something totally different. And there was only one situation where he said ... one stipulation he said, ""You have to do this, but you can't use your dance company, you can't use The Scanner Boys."" Because we were a straight street dance crew, like ba, ba, ba that's it. That kind of thing. So I was like, ""Okay."" I used them anyway, because I figured we're going to be on stage, what are you going to do? Stop me in the middle of the performance? They can't dance, so.",Rennie Harris,"Interview, Transcript, Rennie Harris, Gesel Mason, You Are Why!, No Boundaries Performance 2191"
00:11:47,00:11:51,I used Scanner Boys at the very end and the last piece I called Puremovement.,Rennie Harris,"Interview, Transcript, Rennie Harris, Gesel Mason, You Are Why!, No Boundaries Performance 2192"
